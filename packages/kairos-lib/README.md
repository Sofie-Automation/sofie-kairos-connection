# KAIROS-connection

_Note: This library is not affiliated with Panasonic in any way._

A small utilities and types library for the [`kairos-connection`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kairos-connection) package. It exposes shared TypeScript types and helper utilities so projects that cannot or should not pull in the full connection package can still interact with Kairos types and references.
